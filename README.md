# Mass Spring System (pendulum phaseplane)
A program showcasing the dampening effect of a mass spring system. Multiple programs based aroung Newton's second law of motion. In these programs we are thinking in terms of dampening.
In a mass-spring system we want to consider three forces: restoring, damping and external. This is a model taking into account the vibratiosn of building foundations, vehicle suspension, seismometers, accelerometers, and a damped forced vibration.
