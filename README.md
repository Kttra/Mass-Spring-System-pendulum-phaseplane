# Mass Spring System (pendulum phaseplane)
A program showcasing the dampening effect of a mass spring system. Multiple programs based aroung Newton's second law of motion. In these programs we are thinking in terms of dampening.

In a mass-spring system we want to consider three forces: restoring, damping and external. This is a model taking into account the vibratiosn of building foundations, vehicle suspension, seismometers, accelerometers, and a damped forced vibration.

Now we take a look at the stability.
The stability analysis can also be considered by writing the second order diâ†µerential equation as a system of first order equations.

A classical damped mass-spring system is shown in the following graph.
